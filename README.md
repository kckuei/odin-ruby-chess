### Requirements
- [x] Properly constrained, prevent players from making illegal moves, and declare check or check mate in correct situations
- [x] Save board at any time
- [x] Write tests for important parts
- [x] Keep classes modular and clean, methods each only do one thing; single responsibility principle
- [x] (Optional)(my idea) Chaos/fun mode that scrambles the pieces into random positions
- [ ] (Optional) Build a very simple AI computer player

### Limitations
Implements most of the basic game mechanics (i.e., movement, check, checkmate, castling, pond promotion, etc.), but is still missing a few features:
* En passant
* Stalemate checking
