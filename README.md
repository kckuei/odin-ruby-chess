# Odin: Ruby Chess
Command line chess game implemented with `ruby` for the TOP `ruby` final project. [ðŸ‘‰Live Demo.ðŸ‘ˆ]("")

### Limitations
Implements basic game mechanics (movement and checkmate, etc.), but is still missing a few features:
* En passant
* Pond promotion
* Castling
* Stalemate checking

### Requirements
- [x] Properly constrained, prevent players from making illegal moves, and declare check or check mate in correct situations
- [x] Save board at any time
- [x] Write tests for important parts (TDD not required)
- [x] Keep classes modular and clean, methods each only do one thing; single responsibility principle
- [ ] (Optional) Build a very simple AI computer player
- [x] (Optional my idea) Chaos/fun mode that scrambles the pieces into ramble positions or enable pieces to do crazy/illegal moves
