# Odin: Ruby Chess
A command line chess game implemented with `ruby` for the TOP ruby final project. Uses a composition-ish object-oriented programming approach.

Implements most of the basic game mechanics (i.e., movement, check, checkmate, castling, pond promotion, etc.), in addition to a few easter egg features (e.g. chaos modes). Play against another human, a computer, or spectate by setting up two computers to play against each other in the options menu.
